# HTML-and-CSS-Projects
The 'HTML-and-CSS-Projects' repository
has been used for learning code work.

PROJECTS
========
- One-Page-Website
- Portfolio Website
- Multiple tasks and assignments throughout the HTML & CSS Course.

ONE-PAGE-WEBSITE:
    I chose to customize the One Page Website assignment and created
    a dedicated page to my dogs. This required a substantial amount of
    extra effort to resize images, rethink spacing, and troubleshoot throughout.

PORTFOLIO WEBSITE:
    This project was to reproduce a personal portfolio page which I will continue
    to develop but, for now, it contains the branding, domain name, copy, and imagery that I prefer.
